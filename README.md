# Modern Computational Physics Projects

This repository contains the projects I have made for the Modern Computational
Physics class (PHYS 446) at the University of Urbana-Champaign in the Spring of 2023.

There are five total projects; however, Project 0 was only done to get used to the
class.

The projects are:

- Project 0: Cellular Automata
- Project 1: Quantum Computing
- Project 2: Renormalization Group
- Project 3: Machine Learning
- Project 4: Topological Insulators

They are separated in folders in this directory. Each folder contains more details
on the projects.
